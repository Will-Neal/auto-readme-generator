  # Professional README Generator

  ## Description

  This is a simple command line application that takes in user input and generates a professional README in proper markdown formatting. README's are an essential aspect of every project. One does not publish code without including a README and in the spirit of coders worldwide, we wanted to simplify the process.

  ## Installation
  
  To install the projectr simply download the files and use node/npm to install inquirer. Open a terminal in the correct directory and then call the index.js file by using node.js.

  ## Usage

  After calling the application via node, simply respond to the answer prompts and the README will be automatically generated. Easy! The markdown file will be generated in the output folder and can be edited after the fact. Be careful because generating a new README, will overwrite the previous README.
